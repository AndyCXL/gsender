# ![gSender logo](https://github.com/Sienci-Labs/sender/blob/master/src/app/images/icon-git.png?raw=true)gSender: connect to and control [Grbl](https://github.com/grbl/grbl)-based CNCs

gSender is a feature-packed CNC interface software designed to be clean and easy to learn while retaining a depth of capabilites for advanced users. Its development was begun out of a passion for hobby CNC machines: an interface rebuilt to suit the needs of the at-home CNC user.
* Accepts standard, GRBL-compliant g-code and has been verified to work with many of the common CAM programs
* Began development to bring new concepts to the existing landscape of GRBL senders in an effort to advance functionality and ease-of-use
* Javascript-based CNC interface software which leverages [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) for cross platform use
* Is a branch off of the popular [CNCjs CNC controller interface](https://github.com/cncjs/cncjs) 

Some things that weâ€™re looking to accomplish with this sender:
* Reliability of operation
* Accommodates all ranges of computing systems (low-end PC to RasPi | â€˜light modeâ€™)
* Clean and easy to use no matter your previous CNC experience
* Makes available all normally expected functions
* Addresses common error throwing conditions automatically
* Built-in gadgets for surface probing, stock flattening, firmware editing, and g-code editing with syntax highlighting, command navigation, and more
* 3D cutting visualization
