# gSender: connect to and control [Grbl](https://github.com/grbl/grbl)-based CNCs

gSender is a feature-packed CNC interface software designed to be clean and easy to learn while retaining a depth of capabilites for advanced users. Its development was begun out of a passion for hobby CNC machines: an interface rebuilt to suit the needs of the at-home CNC user.
* Accepts standard, GRBL-compliant g-code and has been verified to work with many of the common CAM programs
* Began development to bring new concepts to the existing landscape of GRBL senders in an effort to advance functionality and ease-of-use
* Javascript-based CNC interface software which leverages [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) for cross platform use
* Is a branch off of the popular [CNCjs CNC controller interface](https://github.com/cncjs/cncjs) 

Some things that weâ€™re looking to accomplish with this sender:
* Reliability of operation
* Accommodates all ranges of computing systems (low-end PC to RasPi | â€˜light modeâ€™)
* Highly easy to use
* Makes available all normally expected functions
* Addresses common error throwing conditions automatically
* Built-in gadgets for surface probing, stock flattening, firmware editing, and g-code editing with syntax highlighting, command navigation, and more
* 3D cutting visualization

## Supported Node.js Versions

 Version | Supported Level
:------- |:---------------
 4       | Dropped support
 6       | Supported
 8       | Supported
 10      | Recommended
 12      | Recommended

## Getting Started

### Node.js Installation

Node.js 8 or higher is recommended. You can install [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage multiple Node.js versions. If you have `git` installed, just clone the `nvm` repo, and check out the latest version:
```
git clone https://github.com/creationix/nvm.git ~/.nvm
cd ~/.nvm
git checkout `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags`
cd ..
. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
```

Add these lines to your `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc`, or `~/.profile` file to have it automatically sourced upon login: 
```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" # This loads nvm
```

Once installed, you can select Node.js versions with:
```
nvm install 10
nvm use 10
```

It's also recommended that you upgrade npm to the latest version. To upgrade, run:
```
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

Install cncjs as a non-root user, or the [serialport](https://github.com/node-serialport/node-serialport) module may not install correctly on some platforms like Raspberry Pi.
```
npm install -g cncjs
```

If you're going to use sudo or root to install cncjs, you need to specify the `--unsafe-perm` option to run npm as the root account.
```
sudo npm install --unsafe-perm -g cncjs
```

Check out [https://github.com/cncjs/cncjs/wiki/Installation](https://github.com/cncjs/cncjs/wiki/Installation) for other installation methods.

### Upgrade

Run `npm install -g cncjs@latest` to install the latest version. To determine the version, use `cncjs -V`.

### Usage

Run `cncjs` to start the server, and visit `http://yourhostname:8000/` to view the web interface. Pass `--help` to `cncjs` for more options.

```
pi@rpi3$ cncjs -h

  Usage: cncjs [options]


  Options:

    -V, --version                       output the version number
    -p, --port <port>                   Set listen port (default: 8000)
    -H, --host <host>                   Set listen address or hostname (default: 0.0.0.0)
    -b, --backlog <backlog>             Set listen backlog (default: 511)
    -c, --config <filename>             Set config file (default: ~/.cncrc)
    -v, --verbose                       Increase the verbosity level (-v, -vv, -vvv)
    -m, --mount <route-path>:<target>   Add a mount point for serving static files
    -w, --watch-directory <path>        Watch a directory for changes
    --access-token-lifetime <lifetime>  Access token lifetime in seconds or a time span string (default: 30d)
    --allow-remote-access               Allow remote access to the server (default: false)
    --controller <type>                 Specify CNC controller: Grbl|Marlin|Smoothie|TinyG|g2core (default: '')
    -h, --help                          output usage information

  Examples:

    $ cncjs -vv
    $ cncjs --mount /pendant:/home/pi/tinyweb
    $ cncjs --mount /widget:~+/widget --mount /pendant:~/pendant
    $ cncjs --mount /widget:https://cncjs.github.io/cncjs-widget-boilerplate/v1/
    $ cncjs --watch-directory /home/pi/watch
    $ cncjs --access-token-lifetime 60d  # e.g. 3600, 30m, 12h, 30d
    $ cncjs --allow-remote-access
    $ cncjs --controller Grbl
```

Instead of passing command line options for `--watch-directory`, `--access-token-lifetime`, `--allow-remote-access`, and `--controller`, you can create a `~/.cncrc` file that contains the following configuration in JSON format:
```json
{
    "mountPoints": [
        {
            "route": "/pendant",
            "target": "/home/pi/tinyweb"
        },
        {
            "route": "/widget",
            "target": "https://cncjs.github.io/cncjs-widget-boilerplate/v1/"
        }
    ],
    "watchDirectory": "/path/to/dir",
    "accessTokenLifetime": "30d",
    "allowRemoteAccess": false,
    "controller": ""
}
```

To troubleshoot issues, run:
```
cncjs -vvv
```

### Configuration File

The configuration file <b>.cncrc</b> contains settings that are equivalent to the cncjs command-line options. The configuration file is stored in user's home directory. To find out the actual location of the home directory, do the following:

* Linux/Mac
  ```sh
  echo $HOME
  ```

* Windows
  ```sh
  echo %USERPROFILE%
  ```

Check out an example configuration file [here](https://github.com/cncjs/cncjs/blob/master/examples/.cncrc).
